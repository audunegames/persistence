# Audune Persistence

[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.audune.persistence?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.audune.persistence/)

Store persistent data from your components on disk or in the cloud with an easily configurable persistence system.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/audunegames/persistence/wiki) of the repository to get started with the package.

## Features

* A persistence system component that is configured solely with components on a GameObject. Add adapters to the system to specify filesystems or cloud services to save and load data. Acces the functonality of the system through scripting.
* Save and load the state of a component using interfaces to mark them as serializable, deserializable, or both. Craft a state structure reminiscent of JSON to persist only the data you want to persist.
* List over files in the adapters and move, copy, or delete them through scripting.
* Define custom backends to define how the state is stored in a file. The persistene system uses [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) to serialize states by default, but this can easily be changed on the component.
* Define custom adapters for different filesystems or cloud services. A local filesystem adapter is included.
